abstract: "Pollution of online social spaces caused by rampaging d/misinformation is a growing societal concern. To tackle these issues, it is crucial to describe and understand group behaviors on online social platforms. In this presentation, we will go through novel methods and techniques to study groups and their temporal evolution, with applications to debates on social media. We will focus on hypergraphs — models that can encode larger-than-binary interactions — and graph communities — clusters extracted from network data — and highlight the nuances these structures bring to research on digital social dynamics."
