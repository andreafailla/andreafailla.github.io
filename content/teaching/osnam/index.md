This is the page for the Online Social Network Analysis and Mining (OSNAM) module of the Machine Learning course at UCBL, Lyon, France.

### Course Description
This module will cover the following topics:
- Link Prediction
- Community Detection
- Mining Text Data in Online Social Networks
- Homophily, Polarization, and Echo Chamber detection


### Lecture 1: Link Prediction

Synopsis: This lecture will introduce the problem of link prediction in social networks, and will cover some of the most popular methods to solve it.
Then, we will move to performance evaluation and discuss some key challenges in this task.

### Lecture 2: Community Detection

Synopsis: This lecture introduces community detection in networks, focusing on identifying meso-scale structures using various algorithms. It discusses the challenges of defining and evaluating communities due to the ill-posed nature of the problem, highlighting approaches like modularity-based methods, bridge detection, and feature-based clustering. The lecture emphasizes the importance of community discovery for understanding functional modules in complex systems and concludes with tools and benchmarks for evaluation, referencing key readings and a Python library for practical application.
